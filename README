NAME
    App::SmokeBrew::Plugin::BINGOS - a smokebrew plugin to configure things
    like BINGOS does

VERSION
    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
      # smokebrew.cfg

      [BINGOS]
      relay = myrelay
      port = 8080

      # then run

      $ smokebrew --plugin App::SmokeBrew::Plugin::BINGOS

DESCRIPTION
    App::SmokeBrew::Plugin::BINGOS is a App::SmokeBrew::Plugin for smokebrew
    which configures the built perl installations for CPAN Testing with
    CPANPLUS::YACSmoke and sending test reports to a metabase-relayd host
    using Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket.

    It will set up the CPANPLUS / CPANPLUS::YACSmoke base locations to be in
    the "conf" directory under the given "prefix" directory with a directory
    for each perl version.

CONFIGURATION
    This plugin requires two attributes: "relay" - the hostname or IP
    address of a metabase-relayd host and "port" - the TCP port of the
    metabase-relayd on that host.

    These attributes should be specified in the "smokebrew.cfg" file under a
    named section:

      [BINGOS]

      relay = some.host
      port = 8080

METHODS
    "configure"
        Called by smokebrew to perform the CPAN Testing configuration.
